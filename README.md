# In this project, I am going to create a website with
# a homepage (index) that links to a few other pages
# with recipes either listed or described in paragraph
# format.

# Once I have completed this project, I will have demonstrated
# the following skills: git workflow, webpage setup,
# list and image and link embedding, emphasis, and other
# basic html element knowledge.
